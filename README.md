blog
====

Ruby on Rails project for geekwise class.
Simple blog. CRUD, authenticates, 
paginates, users own posts, some actions restricted 
to signed in user.
My first rails project. Learned a lot. But I think 
its time to start with other projects, partly 
because this was a messy project developing-wise, and
want to start fresh.
